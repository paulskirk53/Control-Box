This is the software which controls the Astrodome at Gowerobservatory.org. It uses the Arduino framework and integrates with my ASCOM dome driver to facilitate ASCOM functions
such as slew to Azimuth, Slew Status, Emergency Stop. It also incorporates features to minimise power use by switching power on/ off as required by the dome function.
I'm grateful for the help I had from Tom Howe and other folks at the ASCOM developers help forum
I'm happy to share all my software for free, accepting no liability for any problems it may cause.
The software is stable, having been developed over 10 years and controls my Observatory when the weather in Swansea allows :)
